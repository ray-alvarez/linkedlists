<p><i>What is Linked List?</i></p>
<p>A <i>linked list</i> is a linear collection of data elements called nodes that "point" to the next node by means of a pointer.</p>

<p>Each node holds a single element of data and a linke or pointer to the next node in the list.</p>

<p>A head node is the first node in the list, a tail node is the last node in the list.</p>
